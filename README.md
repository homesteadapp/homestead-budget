# Homestead Budget

The modern and free budgeting app everyone can understand!


## Why Homestead Budget?

- **Free, Forever**: Everyone needs to budget, but not everyone can pay for expensive subscriptions.
- **Own Your Data**: Self host your own instance of Homestead. Backup and protect your data how you see fit.
- **Focused and Clean**: Modern budgeting tools are often cluttered and hard to use. Homestead is not.

## Technology

Homestead is a standard C# API backed by a MySQL database. On the frontend we use [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for styling and [React](https://reactjs.org/)/[TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) to make the app interactive.
